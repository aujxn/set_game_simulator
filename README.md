This program simulates set games to count how often hands contain no sets.

Inspired by analysis by Peter Norvig (norvig.com/SET.html) and Don Knuth (cs.stanford.edu/~knuth/programs/setset-all.w)
as well as conversations with Neil Babson.

Note: compile/run for release or it is very slow. Currently at release it takes about 15 seconds to play a million games on my old AMD with a single thread.
